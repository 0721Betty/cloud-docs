# VPC Peering connection configuration

> This feature is not available in free trial and shared deployment

A VPC peering connection is a network connection between two VPCs. Through this connection, the instances in the two VPCs can communicate with each other as if they were in the same network.



## Precautions

1. EMQ X Cloud only supports creating peering connections in **same region**.
2. EMQ X Cloud does not support network segments within the range of `10.10.0.0/24 ï½ž 10.32.255.0/24`, please plan your VPC network segment reasonably.
3. Resources of peering connections and rule engine  are bound to each other. Please create a peering connection before creating resources.



## Peering connection of Ali Cloud platform 

In Ali Cloud platform, VPC peering connection is also called [Cloud enterprise network](https://cn.aliyun.com/product/cbn)

### Create a peering connection

1. Log in to your Ali Cloud account and enter [Cloud Enterprise Network Page](<https://cen.console.aliyun.com/cen/list>)

2. Click to Create Cloud Enterprise Network Instance

3. Fill in the VPC related information, and click OK

   > Note: A VPC can only be associated with one cloud enterprise network

4. Log in to [EMQ X Cloud console](<https://cloud.emqx.io/console>), enter the page of required deployment details, click the `+VPC peering connection` button, and fill in the relevant information of your Alibaba Cloud Enterprise Network, and record the EMQ X Cloud VPC peering connection prompt

   * Peer-to-peer connection ID == Cloud Enterprise Network instance ID
   * Account ID == Alibaba Cloud account ID
   * VPC ID == VPC ID attached to the cloud enterprise network

### Delete peering connection

To delete a peering connection, you need to make sure that the peer-to-peer connection status is `running`

> Note: Before deleting the peering connection, make sure that there are no associated resources in the deployment, otherwise it will cause unpredictable risks

1. Enter deployment details page

2. Click the `Delete button` on the right side of the peering connection

## Peering connection of HUAWEI cloud platform 

### Create a peering connection

1. Log in to the [EMQ X Cloud console](<https://cloud.emqx.io/console>), enter the required deployment details, click the `+VPC peering connection` button, and record the EMQ X Cloud VPC peering connection prompt
    > Note: Do not close this page yet

   * Deploy VPC ID
   * EMQ X Cloud account ID
   * Deploy VPC network segment

3. Click `Peeing connection` -> `Create peering connection` and select another account. Fill in the information just recorded in [EMQ X Cloud Console](<https://cloud.emqx.io/console>), click OK to create a peering connection request

    * Peering project ID == EMQ X Cloud account ID
    * Peering VPC ID == deployment VPC ID

    ![create_huawei_vpc_peering](./_assets/huawei_create_vpc_peering.png)

4. On the peering connection information interface, record the following 3 value

    * 1 is the peering connection ID
    * 2 is the VPC network segment
    * 3 is the VPC ID

7. In the HUAWEI CLOUD console, open `Virtual Private Cloud VPC` -> `Route Table`, and add the deployed VPC network segment in step 1 to the routing table of the corresponding VPC

    > Note: The next hop type is peering connection
